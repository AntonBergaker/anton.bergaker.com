			p
				| Pentapop is one of my larger projects, trying to make use of the resources I had previously created for miniSweeper.
				| It's a two player board game very similar to Gomoku / Five in a row where you try and get five in a row before the opponent does.
			p
				| The project turned out to be significantly more involved than miniSweeper, featuring both local AI as well as online play with an account system.
				| Due to the modern requirements of online accounts, this is where most of the time was spent. Things like password recovery / password management etc. and other account legal requirements.

			p
				| The client is written in GameMaker making heavy use of extensions, some of which I've published seperately.

			p
				| The server is written in C# and is mostly custom without using many frameworks.
				| Mainly because there's not many frameworks that work well with binary data which is used because it works well with GameMaker and a way to keep costs down.
