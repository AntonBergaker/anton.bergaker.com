			p 
				| If you're like me, you've probably also struggled to learn to tell the time at some point in your life.
				| A bunch of arbitrary divisions that make absolutely no sense. When does the AM/PM go? When does it reset, on 12 or after?
				| Why are they divided into 12ths and 60ths? Madness!
			p
				| Can we really make fun of the janks for their inches in a stone in a footlong when we also use a system with weird divisions?
				| That is as much as 10 football fields worth of conversions.

				| Decimal time solves all this and more! The day is represented by a single number, going from 0 to 1.
				| You can be as precise as you wish, by simply adding or removing decimals. It's also more compact, because no number has a boundary at 12 or 60.
			p
				| This website does not use time zones and will start the day at midnight UTC. It's possible to use decimal time with time zones, but that's a separate discussion.
