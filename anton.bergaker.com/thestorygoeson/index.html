			<h2>The Story Goes On</h2>
			<p><i>“You are the hero inside the storybook of an obsessed author pondering with his life’s work. Explore repeating worlds, befriend a talking scarecrow and swing your sword really fast, while uncovering the true, overarching adventure within.”</i></p>
			<p>The Story Goes On was my first project at Scarecrow Arts. I took over as the games Lead Programmer in March 2015 and worked on the project for three years until it's release in March 2018. The game features randomly generated levels, a load of items, a few carefully scripted pre-made dungeons and much more.</p>

			<p>My role as the Lead Programmer meant I was responsible for implementing all features into the game. This put me in touch with all elements of game development, as everything had to pass through me.<br/>
				I was also responsible for bringing the game to Xbox One and I developed multiple internal tools to take over various manual tasks, mostly related to formatting our localization data to the various storefronts and into the game.</p>
