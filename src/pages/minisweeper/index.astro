        <p>
            miniSweeper is a small project I made because I was not satisfied
            with any MineSweeper games on Android. As projects tend to do,
            slowly it became more involved and it's not available on four
            different platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game is made in GameMaker Studio 2 with some modifications for
            the Android export. The game is completely open source.
